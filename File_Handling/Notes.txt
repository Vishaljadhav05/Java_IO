FILE HANDLING:- 

=> File :
    -> A file is an object on a computer which stores the data, information, settings, commands etc.
    -> There are many file operations for eg. creating new file, rename file, deleting file, writing into file, reading from the file etc.
    
-> There are 2 ways by which we can read data form the file :-
    1. Sequential Access : In this way we can read or write the data in sequential form i.e. from beginning or starting of the file.
    2. Random Access : In this way we can read or write the data in random way i.e. from any location of the file.

-> To perform these operations java provided many classes and methods but main class is "java.io.File" class.
