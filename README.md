# Java I/O Learning Repository ☕📁

This repository is created to **learn and practice the concept of Java Input and Output (I/O)**.  
It contains examples, notes, and hands-on code to understand how data is read from and written to different sources like files and console.

## What I’m Learning
- Basics of Java I/O
- Streams in Java
- Types of Streams:

- Console input handling
- Serialization & Deserialization
- Exception handling in I/O operations

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Core Java I/O APIs
- IDE: IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code

## Learning Goals
- Understand how Java handles input and output operations
- Work confidently with files and streams
- Write efficient and reliable file-handling code
- Prepare for Java I/O related interview questions
- Apply I/O concepts in real-world Java applications
